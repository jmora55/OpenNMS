Once you have created a webhook channel for Slack follow steps ↓

attach to container by typing cmd: sudo docker exec -it (ContainerName) /bin/bash

then navigate to path work directory in container: /opt/opennms/etc

Find notificationCommands.xml and modify it using vi or nano


##sudo nano notificationCommands.xml##

 </command>
   <command binary="false">
      <name>slack</name>
      <execute>org.opennms.netmgt.notifd.SlackNotificationStrategy</execute>
      <comment>class for sending messages to a Slack team channel for notifications</comment>
      <argument streamed="false">
         <switch>-subject</switch>
      </argument>
      <argument streamed="false">
         <switch>-tm</switch>
      </argument>
   </command>
</notification-commands>


save and close vi: :wq or nano ctrl+X

Then CD to opennms.properties.d while in the same dir /opt/opennms/etc

once in /opt/opennms/etc/opennms.properties.d → create a new file called slack.properties

##In slack.properties add your webhook url and following lines##

org.opennms.netmgt.notifd.slack.webhookURL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/xxxx/xxxxx/xxxxxxxxx
org.opennms.netmgt.notifd.slack.username=opennms
org.opennms.netmgt.notifd.slack.channel=#opennmsnotifications (Replace with name of your channel)

NOTE: You should be good after this. But you still have to configure the GUI 
Turn on Notification Status in Settings 

Then: 
Login to opennms
Go to the settings icon; you have to be an Admin
Navigate to configure Notifications (Note: by default notifications are turned off. Make sure to enable it after the modifications)
Select Configure Modification Path
I just edited the Email-Admin setting to use slack instead of javamail
This is after you click the first edit; then select edit on initial targets
Leave defaults and click next step 
Select next step again
Here change the default javamail to slack, hit next and then at the next page save/finish
YOU ARE DONE: you should receive emails to your Slack channel
